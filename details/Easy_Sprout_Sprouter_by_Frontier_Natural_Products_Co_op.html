However the easy sprouter drains much better and frees up your dish drainer for dishes.The instructions could be written a tiny bit better, I agree, and I recommend you supplement with you tube videos by sproutpeople.I do prefer to use much, much less water than the sproutpeople guy uses (Earth day was just April 22nd) so I do what the pamphlet that comes with the easysprouter recommends for SALAD sprouts (because I only grow SALAD sprouts).1.I soak the seeds for 12 hours2. Rinse thoroughly and drain very thoroughly2. Then every 12 hours, I soak the sprouts for 5 to 15 minutes just like the pamphlet that come with the easysprouter recommends for SALAD sprouts (as opposed to bean sprouts).(I soak for 10 minutes)3.Then I rinse thoroughly, not nearly as long as the sproutpeople guy does, but I do make sure the water runs clear and sprouts smell nice and fresh.4.Then I use centrifugal force to THOROUGHLY drain the sprouts each time.I do it the way the pamphlet recommends, but the sproutpeople guy demonstrates another way which also works great.I apologize for calling him the sproutpeople guy instead of using his name, but none of the videos mention his name.I do know his cute little dog's name cuz he introduced him in one of his microgreen videos. His dog's name is Chester.Do watch some sproutpeople videos. Just be sure to either rinse, rinse, rinse, and rinse for what seems like long and torturous eternity or else just soak sprouts between 5 and 15 minutes every 12 hours, and THEN rinse thoroughly until the water runs clear, and your freshly soaked and rinsed sprouts pass the sniff test. They should ALWAYS smell nice and fresh (p.s. broccoli sprouts do have a unique aroma and that unique smell is a good thing).5 stars.The pamplet just doesn't make it clear enough that bean sprouting is different (and much easier) than salad seed (alfalfa, broccoli, clover, mustard, radish, etc.) seed sprouting.I'm thinking these would make nice gifts too.",

	var commentsList = [{"user":"lightdancing","content":"This sprouter works with very small seeds like alfalfa, broccoli and quinoa seeds, as well as larger seeds like mung beans and garbanzos.Included are 2 cups - an outer cup and the inner cup which slides inside of the outer cup.The two cups are designed so that you can lower the inner cup into the outer cup, pour the seeds in and the water, and soak the seeds.And, after soaking, turn the inner cup inside the outer cup so that it lifts up, creating a larger space for water to drain into the outer cup when doing the daily rinses.And you can also lift the inner cup all the way out of the outer cup and water drains out of its bottom drain very fast.For tiny seeds, this sprouter has an extra fine strainer which snaps into the bottom of the inner cup to prevent the tiny seeds from falling through.You can see how that works by calling up Easy Sprout Sprouter on youtube and choose the video which shows how to grow broccoli sprouts.It has 3 lids -a belled ventilated top which provides room for sprouts that grow higher than the inner cup, a flat ventilated top and a solid top for storing the sprouts should you want to use the sprouter to store them as well as grow them.I was brand spankin' new to sprouting when I ordered my first Easy Sprout Sprouter.At the same time, I ordered a jar with a plastic drain cap","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2012-09-23 20:39:01"},{"user":"Dusty","content":"This is my third Easy Sprouter, and all are in use on my counter constantly. Easy Sprouter is THE easiest to use and clean of any sprouter I've ever used, and I've used at least 6 others. Just soak seeds, beans or grain, then rinse & drain. Rinse & drain thoroughly twice a day till done. I've had failures with other sprouters, even following directions perfectly. The only 'crop' failures I've had with ES were totally my fault, like forgetting to rinse & drain for several days (tho it's forgiving enough I've been able to save a few of those). My Easy Sprouters also take up the least room for the most sprouts. One of them is four years old and still works great.I use them for leafy sprouts, and to hull, about the 3rd day dump them in a big bowl, pour cold water in and swish vigorously but gently to loosen and remove the hulls, then grab a handful of sprouts, rotate your handful quickly in the center of the bowl to clear hulls away, and pull out fast, putting them into the inner sprouting cup. Do that with the rest and you've quickly & easily removed most of the hulls.I sprout almost all beans I'll be cooking, or making into hummus, as it increases nutrition drastically, and takes the place of soaking. I also sprout then freeze sprouted beans in freezer bags, so I can make a bean dish, depending on bean type & recipe, in 30 min to a couple hours cooking/total time.Easy Sprouter works great for sprouting grain, I like to add sprouted white wheat, millet, brown rice, amaranth, quinoa, barley... singly or combinations, to salads, smoothies, breakfast cereals raw or cooked, soups and stews. We also tend to just munch sprouted grains as is, they're sweet, tasty & chewy.You can also sprout mixed grains & beans, we like a mix of rice and 3 types of beans for a soup/stew (I often start the beans, then soak & add grains a day later).I also sprout Mung beans a little longer than suggested to get a long root and shoot, tho I'd need to use heavy weight to try for the heavy 'bean sprout' root & stem.Cleaning is easy, just like washing a couple large tumblers, I always hand wash them. Several of the other sprouters I've had, I needed to cut, scrub and pick off roots from screens, and scrub awkward areas, taking a long time to clean them thoroughly.Need I say I recommend Easy Sprouter highly?I just wish I could buy the small seed screens separately, I've lost one.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2012-04-24 20:39:01"},{"user":"Helen L.","content":"This sprouter seemed expensive when I ordered it but it's definitely worth the price due to its simplicity.I had a very successful sprouting experience on my first try!These are the items in the box:- Solid outer cup- Slit bottom inner cup- Slit insert for smaller seeds like alfalfa- Domed slit lid for measurement and ventilation- Vented lid for storage- Solid lid for air-tight storageI purchased Todd's Seeds Broccoli & Friends mix and here are my steps for sprouting with the Easy Sprouter:I used 2 - 3 tablespoons of this seed mixture to sprout in the Easy Sprout.My house is coolish in the winter (55F - 65F) so I put the Easy Sprouter in the oven which is a bit warmer than the rest of the house.If you need to make it even warmer, turn on the oven light to add a bit more heat!NEVER turn on the oven itself as that would cook the seeds and melt your Easy Sprouter!Here are my sprouting steps for my sprouter:1.Since there are small alfalfa seeds in this mix, put in the small-slit insert to the inner slit cup to prevent these seeds from washing out.Put the inner cut into the outer cup.Soak 2 - 3 tablespoons of seed in the sprouter for 12 hours.Put on the slit dome cap to allow aeration.Put the sprouter in the oven for a warmer environment if needed.Otherwise, leave it on the kitchen counter.(You do not need light for sprouting.)2.Pull out the inner cup (with the slits) to drain out the water. Turn on the faucet to give the seeds a \"shower\" and allow the water to drain out completely.Shake the inner cup and tap it against the sides of the sink to drain out all water.Put the inner cup back into the outer cup (solid cup without slits).Put back on the slit dome and put the sprouter back into the oven.3. Repeat #2 every 12 hours for about 4 days.It's necessary to give your sprouts showers to wash off any potential mold and to maintain moisture around the seeds.4. To store your sprouts, just take off the dome lid and put on the vented lid.It'll keep for about a week or so.For videos and recipes, check out SproutPeople.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2012-03-07 20:39:01"},{"user":"Amazon Customer","content":"I honestly am not sure what the magic is about this that gives me such amazing sprouts, but I have my suspicion. I was using large glass mason jars with decent success before this, but purchased this because I'm thinking of traveling and wanted a travel sprouter ... I came across their Youtube videos which helped me a lot to understand the importance of the circular or centrifugal motion action when rinsing (I hadn't heard that before) and also draining really well. One thing I do different is I rinse only once a day because once I did that by accident and I liked the results. (They grow just as well this way if not better, for me.) I think this sprouter gives me such strong and vibrant sprouts because of I am always rinsing from the tap (the pressure of the water seems to benefit the sprouts), and then swirling and spinning the sprouts several times per rinse (apparently they like this action, too), then draining very well (feeling the bottom to make sure no more water comes out). The combo of these actions is a winner...the sprouts grow fast and sturdy, with little waste, and with less effort than the mason jar. I also like the size of this jar, compared to the larger mason jars. Everyone says that you should spread out the seeds so they are not piled on one another, but with this system, that does not hinder their growth, I think because of the previous reasons. I highly recommend this system to anyone who wants a foolproof sprouting system! I've tried mason jars, stacking trays and more....I can say for sure this is by far the easiest, best, most foolproof, least wasteful.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2022-12-31 20:39:01"},{"user":"B.

I spent a lot of time at sproutpeople in preparation for this venture (I highly recommend their sprouting seed). In particular, this sprouter is ideal for broccoli (and other brassicas). Those require special consideration; broccoli (and other brassica) seeds are mucilaginous, so you can't really grow them upright (I haven't tried, that's just what I read)... so it's either something like this or a growing medium to raise them as microgreeens.One limitation: if you don't have air conditioning, you will probably not be able to keep up with sprouts in these over the summer. I ended up suspending all sprouting until the fall. There's just no keeping up with additional rinsing; sprouts just do not like the heat even in a dark countertop corner. This isn't a problem with the sprouter, it's just the way of sprouts (in my limited experience). Next summer, I may try to conduct my sprouting in the EasySprout kept in the fridge. This might work, but maybe summertime produce is enough for my diet.So, in my year of sprouting, I have sprouted many kinds in the EasySprout. I have since devised my own contraptions out of splatter screens and fine mesh strainers that I prefer for leafy sprouts, but the EasySprout remains essential for broccoli sprouts and has become the dedicated vessel for that.I even made a second unit out of a quart container with a thumbtack and boxcutter. It is not as good, but works well to keep a second batch going with a single EasySprout. I start a batch and see it through. When it's done or at least nearly done, I transfer my crop to my diy version and get another batch going. I continue to rinse and drain until they are gone; sometimes I relocate them to the fridge. It's a challenge to eat them all, but that's a great problem to have.So, a year into enthusiastic sprouting, and I still find the EasySprout essential for broccoli and other brassica sprouts. It's fairly indestructible and suitable for just about any sprout. Following the advice of another reviewer, I do not use the small seed insert. It may come in handy someday. Personally, I recommend running it through the dishwasher periodically (if that's an option), handwashing doesn't always cut it.Even if the EasySprout had outlived its usefulness, I would still value it highly for all the sprouts and sprouting it has provided with little capital investment. This really sparked a hobby and upgraded my diet for $13 (plus seeds). As things stand, I still need it for broccoli and brassica sprouts, which to me are the most important (nutritionally-- check out nutritionfacts for the intel).I'm about to embark on adventures in microgreens. Look at me grow!","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2016-12-27 20:39:01"},{"user":"Amazon Customer","content":"I had stopped sprouting for years as I couldn't get anything to work in Florida.I had beautiful clay sprouters, which had constant bug attacks.Then I tried to sprout with Ball jars and couldn't get much to sprout at all.I never wanted to get this Easy Sprout sprouter because it's made of plastic.But I finally broke down and bought one.Happy to report that I just put my first batch of sprouts into the fridge.Looks like everything germinated and they grew great and very fast.I followed the sprout people video on getting all the water out after rinsing.I think that is key.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-11 20:39:01"},{"user":"Nocturnal","content":"I just got this last week so over the weekend I started my first crop.I've never don't sprouts-that-you-eat-as-sprouts.I've sprouted plants that grow in dirt though.And I detest alfalfa sprouts.I do like mung (cooked), soy sprouts, radish sprouts and I'm hoping I can sprout seeds and munch on them as snacks.I figure if it comes to it, I can even keep a sprouter going at work so when I can't break away for lunch, I can have fresh sprouts of my own choosing (although it'll take a bit of pre-planning).My sprouter cam with \"instructions\" which were vague but I assume that's because so much depends on the type of seeds you are using--beans will need different timing then alfalfa or smaller seeds, etc.I went to sproutpeople.com to get specific instructions about type of seeds I'm hoping to sprout (they have very good instructions although my printouts cut off the right edge of them; they also have YouTube vids if you're not into reading; they also sell and ship seeds and equipment).My sprouter came with 5-6 pieces (lids and things) but no seeds so I ran out and bought a bunch of radish seeds at the hardware store, dumped 4 packs into the sprouter just to see if they would sprout--they won't make a meal's worth but it's my test run.So far, and I'm on day 2.5 now, they are sprouting great and I go to talk to them (\"o, look how bit you guys are getting!\") at least twice daily when I rinse them.They smell fresh and green (forgot about that aspect, nice to be reminded).What I like about this sprouter is that I don't need to buy any additional equipment; everything except the seeds came in the box so I didn't have to make a huge investment.I can soak, rinse, grow, and maybe store in this same container using the various pieces.I'll probably not store my sprouts in this since I'll want to start another crop, and I'll be buying a few more of these sprouters so I can always have sprouts available.The container is only a 1 quart size so if you want a ton of sprouts, you'll have to start several, but if you're adding sprouts to salads and other dishes to augment them, or using sprouts as snack food, keeping a couple of these going ought to do.Make sure you can get a supply of seeds; if you have to have them shipped in, factor in shipping costs.And since the sprouter doesn't take up much space or need special heating/light, you can basically set them anywhere flat between rinsings since it's only the last step to green it up (and you can do that under a bright light for a few hours).Sproutpeople.com suggests using a salad spinner to dehull--haven't gotten to reading that yet but I would think you could fill the spinner with water and swish the sprouts through the water first, then drain off the water and do a dry spin and most of the hulls will come off; just find a spinner to suit the size of your seed/sprouts (thin sprouts you probably wouldn't want to spin in a widely-spaced-slat spinner).I would think you could even mix a wee bit of honey, molassus, maybe something like honey-mustard dressing in the last rinse to coat the sprouts with some flavor (if you need that), could sprinkle garlic powder or sesame seeds or cayenne pepper on them.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2011-05-24 20:39:01"},{"user":"Texasgoldengirl","content":"The man who invented this (Gene Monson) deserves a special place in heaven.Like many people,I believed no sprouter ever worked as well as the good old Mason jar technique. However the easy sprouter drains much better and frees up your dish drainer for dishes.The instructions could be written a tiny bit better, I agree, and I recommend you supplement with you tube videos by sproutpeople.I do prefer to use much, much less water than the sproutpeople guy uses (Earth day was just April 22nd) so I do what the pamphlet that comes with the easysprouter recommends for SALAD sprouts (because I only grow SALAD sprouts).1.I soak the seeds for 12 hours2. Rinse thoroughly and drain very thoroughly2. Then every 12 hours, I soak the sprouts for 5 to 15 minutes just like the pamphlet that come with the easysprouter recommends for SALAD sprouts (as opposed to bean sprouts).(I soak for 10 minutes)3.Then I rinse thoroughly, not nearly as long as the sproutpeople guy does, but I do make sure the water runs clear and sprouts smell nice and fresh.4.Then I use centrifugal force to THOROUGHLY drain the sprouts each time.I do it the way the pamphlet recommends, but the sproutpeople guy demonstrates another way which also works great.I apologize for calling him the sproutpeople guy instead of using his name, but none of the videos mention his name.I do know his cute little dog's name cuz he introduced him in one of his microgreen videos. His dog's name is Chester.Do watch some sproutpeople videos. Just be sure to either rinse, rinse, rinse, and rinse for what seems like long and torturous eternity or else just soak sprouts between 5 and 15 minutes every 12 hours, and THEN rinse thoroughly until the water runs clear, and your freshly soaked and rinsed sprouts pass the sniff test. They should ALWAYS smell nice and fresh (p.s. broccoli sprouts do have a unique aroma and that unique smell is a good thing).5 stars.The pamplet just doesn't make it clear enough that bean sprouting is different (and much easier) than salad seed (alfalfa, broccoli, clover, mustard, radish, etc.) seed sprouting.I'm thinking these would make nice gifts too.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2020-05-05 20:39:01"}];
